Feeling optimistic and eager, you sit down and start going through the material that evening.

In the next several weeks, you fall into a pattern of studying coding till late at night, then waking up early the next morning to go to work. But you‚Äôre starting to get confused by some of the concepts, and there isn‚Äôt anyone to ask for help.

You‚Äôve sacrificed your free time, and haven‚Äôt watched TV to unwind in a while. Also, having to miss nights out with friends sucks.

After a couple of months, all the late nights and lack of sleep are starting to weigh down on you. You bitterly come to the realization that you won‚Äôt be anywhere near landing a new job in 6 months. The thought is incredibly discouraging. 

Finally, you decide to take a break‚Äì you‚Äôre feeling burned out and frankly exhausted. That break extends out for further months.

Later that year, you realize you haven‚Äôt cracked open your tutorial for a really long time. Sighing, you shove the thought of someday having a job you love into the back of your mind.

 I make some updates to the django rest-api course.üòë
